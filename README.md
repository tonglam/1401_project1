1401 python project 1

Output:
We expect 4 outputs in the order below.
i) Maximum and Minimum: A list containing the names of organisations having highest
and lowest number of employees in the input country. Your output should be
stored in a list in the following order:
[organisation with maximum number of employees, organisation with minimum
number of employees]
For example: ['weaver-barnett', 'bolton diaz and kent']
ii) Standard Deviation: A list containing the standard deviation of median salary of
organisations for the input country and the standard deviation of median salary
for all the organisations in the dataset. Your output should be stored in a list in the
following order:
[standard deviation for the organisations of the input country, standard deviation
for all the organisations]
For example: [300.5001, 40.0045]
iii) Ratio: A numeric value that is the ratio of ‘sum of profit increases (positive
changes)’ to ‘sum of profit decreases (negative changes)’, from 2020 to 2021.
For example:
Let’s suppose that the changes in profit for different organisations in a country A
from 2020-2021 are: -21, 34, 245, -32, then:

sum of profit increases= 34+245 = 279
sum of profit decreases= 21+32 = 53
ratio= 279/53 = 5.26
iv) Correlation: A numeric value which is a correlation between median salaries and
profits in 2021 for all the organisations in the input country which have an increase
in profits from 2020 to 2021. The expected output is a single float value.
For example: -0.1013
